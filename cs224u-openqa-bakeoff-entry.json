Nicolas Tissot noted that the scale factors at a point on a map projection, specified by the numbers \"h\" and \"k\", define an ellipse at that point. For cylindrical projections, the axes of the ellipse are aligned to the meridians and parallels. For the Mercator projection, \"h\" = \"k\", so the ellipses degenerate into circles with radius proportional to the value of the scale factor for that latitude.

Depending on the value assumed for the astronomical unit, this yields the speed of light as just a little more than 300,000 kilometres per second. The first measurements of the speed of light using completely terrestrial apparatus were published in 1849 by Hippolyte Fizeau (1819\u201396).

There are seven extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.

Thomson Sir Joseph John Thomson (18 December 1856 \u2013 30 August 1940) was an English physicist and Nobel Laureate in Physics, credited with the discovery and identification of the electron; and with the discovery of the first subatomic particle. In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles (now called electrons), which he calculated must have bodies much smaller than atoms and a very large charge-to-mass ratio.

Adding the prefix \"super-\" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word \"supernova\" was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.
